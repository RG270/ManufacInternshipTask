Task description:
1. You are expected to implement a mobile-responsive user authentication (sign-in/out/up) application
using React and MaterialUI. The entire source code should either be in TypeScript or JavaScript.
2. Upon successful sign-in, a welcome screen should be displayed. That screen should allow the user to
sign-out as well. If the user doesnâ€™t have login credentials, an option to sign-up should be present in
the app.
3. Back-end/server-side integration is not needed but once a user signs up, he/she should be able to
sign-in during the same browser session. You can store the login credentials on client-side for the
purpose of this demo.
4. In the final product, upon running yarn start, the browser should open with the desired app
rendered.
5. No other helper libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. should be used.
